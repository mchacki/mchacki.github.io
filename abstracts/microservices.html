      <h1>NoSQL meets microservices</h1>
      <h3>Duration</h3>
      <p>30 - 45min</p>
      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>No in-depth knowledge of databases or microservice architecture is required. This talk will shed some light onto both topics and how they could be used in combination.
     <h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
Just a few years ago all software systems were designed to be monoliths running on a single big and powerful machine.
But nowadays most companies desire to scale out instead of scaling up, because it is much easier to buy or rent a large cluster of commodity hardware then to get a single machine that is powerful enough.
In the database area scaling out is realized by utilizing a combination of polyglot persistence and sharding of data.
On the application level scaling out is realized by microservices.
In this talk I will briefly introduce the concepts and ideas of microservices and discuss their benefits and drawbacks.
Afterwards I will focus on the point of intersection of a microservice based application talking to one or many NoSQL databases.
We will try and find answers to these questions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Are the differences to a monolithic application?</li>
        <li>How to scale the whole system properly?</li>
        <li>What about polyglot persistence?</li>
        <li>Is there a data-centric way to split microservices?</li>
      </ul>
