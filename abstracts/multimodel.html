      <h1>Polyglot Persistence & Multi-Model NoSQL Databases</h1>
      <h3>Duration</h3>
      <p>30 - 60min</p>
      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>No in-depth knowledge of NoSQL databases is required. The audience should directly be interfacing with databases.
     <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p> In many modern applications the database side is realized using polyglot persistence â€“ store each data format (graphs, documents, etc.) in an appropriate separate database.
This approach yields several benefits, databases are optimized for their specific duty, however there are also drawbacks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>keep all databases in sync</li>
        <li>queries might require data from several databases</li>
        <li>experts needed for all used systems</li>
      </ul>
      <p> A multi-model database is not restricted to one data format, but can cope with several of them.
In this talk I will present how a multi-model database can be used in a polyglot persistence setup and how it will reduce the effort drastically.</p>
